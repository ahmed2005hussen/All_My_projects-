## **1. Simple Substitution Cipher (C++)**
A substitution cipher program to encode or decode messages using a custom key.

### **Features**
- Encrypt a message using a substitution key.
- Decrypt a message back to its original form.
- Validates the key to ensure it's unique and adheres to constraints.

### **How to Use**
1. Run the program.
2. Choose:
   - **1**: Cipher a message.
   - **2**: Decipher a message.
   - **3**: Exit the program.

## **2. Number Scrabble (Python)**
A fun two-player game where each player selects numbers from 1 to 9, trying to sum 15 using exactly three numbers.

### **Rules**
1. The game is played by **2 players**.
2. Players take turns picking a number from 1 to 9.
3. A number cannot be reused after selection.
4. A player wins by forming **exactly 15** using three selected numbers.
5. If no player achieves this and all numbers are used, the game ends in a **draw**.

### **How to Use**
